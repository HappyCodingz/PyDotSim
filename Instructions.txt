Installation:

1) Install a Python environment including matplotlib, numpy, and scipy

2) Copy the file PyDotSim.py and the folder lib to a folder of your choice

3) Open the file PyDotSim.py with your Python IDE and start it

Usage:

Check the materials properties by the button <materials>

Select the quantum dot (QD) shape

Select the QD size, the simulation parameters, and the fields

You may add point charges 

Select the particle exciton X, biexciton XX, etc

Select the number of self-consistent loops (SL) for the correlation correction (SL=0 means without)

Select the threshold for the wave function analyses (values below 0.01 may compute very slow)

Press button <Create model> (required after every change of the parameters)

If the QD size is changed, you can adjust the cell size by the button <Auto cell>

Press <Compute> to start e simulation. The results are given in the log window.

Press <Analyze WF> to analyze the wave functions. The results are given in the log window.

You can define series of selected parameters. A series is stared by the button <Series go> and the results are stores in a CSV file.
